                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing observations over time and geography is a common task, but typically requires multiple, separate tools. The objective of our research has been to develop a method to visualize, and work with, the spatial interconnectedness of information over time and geography within a single, highly interactive three-dimensional (3-D) view. A novel visualization technique for displaying and tracking events, objects and activities within a combined temporal and geospatial display has been developed. This technique has been implemented as a demonstrable prototype called GeoTime in order to determine potential utility. Capabilities include descriptive events and relationships, association analysis, event aggregation methods and geo-located linked charting. Initial evaluations have been with military users. However, we believe the concept is applicable to a variety of government and business analysis tasks.</p>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Visual Exploration of Big Spatio-Temporal Urban Data: A Study of New York City Taxi Trips</small></h3>

                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As increasing volumes of urban data are captured and become available, new opportunities arise for data-driven analysis that can lead to improvements in the lives of citizens through evidence-based decision making and policies. In this paper, we focus on a particularly important urban data set: taxi trips. Taxis are valuable sensors and information associated with taxi trips can provide unprecedented insight into many different aspects of city life, from economic activity and human behavior to mobility patterns. But analyzing these data presents many challenges. The data are complex, containing geographical and temporal components in addition to multiple variables associated with each trip. Consequently, it is hard to specify exploratory queries and to perform comparative analyses (e.g., compare different regions over time). This problem is compounded due to the size of the data—there are on average 500,000 taxi trips each day in NYC. We propose a new model that allows users to visually query taxi trips. Besides standard analytics queries, the model supports origin-destination queries that enable the study of mobility across the city. We show that this model is able to express a wide range of spatio-temporal queries, and it is also flexible in that not only can queries be composed but also different aggregations and visual representations can be applied, allowing users to explore and compare results. We have built a scalable system that implements this model which supports interactive response times; makes use of an adaptive level-of-detail rendering strategy to generate clutter-free visualization for large results; and shows hidden details to the users in a summary through the use of overlay heat maps. We present a series of case studies motivated by traffic engineers and economists that show how our model and system enable domain experts to perform tasks that were previously unattainable for them.</p>

                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queries over large scale (petabyte) data bases often mean waiting overnight for a result to come back. Scale costs time. Such time also means that potential avenues of exploration are ignored because the costs are perceived to be too high to run or even propose them. With sampleAction we have explored whether interaction techniques to present query results running over only incremental samples can be presented as sufficiently trustworthy for analysts both to make closer to real time decisions about their queries and to be more exploratory in their questions of the data. Our work with three teams of analysts suggests that we can indeed accelerate and open up the query process with such incremental visualizations.</p>

                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giuseppe Borruso</p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human activities and more generally the phenomena related to human behaviour take place in a network-constrained subset of the geographical space. These phenomena can be expressed as locations having their positions configured by a road network, as address points with street numbers. Although these events are considered as points on a network, point pattern analysis and the techniques implemented in a GIS environment generally consider events as taking place in a uniform space, with distance expressed as Euclidean and over a homogeneous and isotropic space. Network-spatial analysis has developed as a research agenda where the attention is drawn towards point pattern analytical techniques applied to a space constrained by a road network. Little attention has been put on first order properties of a point pattern (i.e. density) in a network space, while mainly second order analysis such as nearest neighbour and K-functions have been implemented for network configurations of the geographical space. In this article, a method for examining clusters of human-related events on a network, called Network Density Estimation (NDE), is implemented using spatial statistical tools and GIS packages. The method is presented and compared to conventional first order spatial analytical techniques such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). Network Density Estimation is tested using the locations of a sample of central, urban activities associated with bank and insurance company branches in the central areas of two midsize European cities, Trieste (Italy) and Swindon (UK).</p>
